# ember-loadMore-example

## Motivation:

It answers the question on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28322103/load-more-content-from-the-server-and-add-it-to-the-page

It presents the way how to implement the `load more` button functionality using Ember.js and its query params feature. The example contains a simple server side that can take two query params: `limit` and `offset`.

Pagination is not implemented, though you can easily do it yourself based on the `load more` button.

Enjoy!
